🚧 Civix – Local Civic Issue Reporting App
Domain: Governance / Public Welfare
Tagline: Empowering citizens, enabling better governance.

Civix is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of reporting, tracking, and resolving local civic issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, and uncollected garbage. It provides a bridge between citizens and municipal authorities, bringing accountability and transparency to local issue resolution.

🚨 Problem Addressed
Local civic issues often go unnoticed or unresolved due to the lack of a structured, user-friendly reporting system. Civix solves this by enabling:

Citizens to report problems easily with images and geolocation.

Transparent status tracking of reported issues.

Community-driven prioritization via upvotes.

A centralized admin dashboard for city workers to manage and resolve issues efficiently.
